## üíª System Requirements

To fully run the simulation environment, it is recommended to have more than 24GB of memory.

## üß© System Components

This simulation environment replicates a complete DDoS attack infrastructure, consisting of the following independently built components:

| Component | Quantity | Description |
|:--------------------:|:--------:|:-------------------------------------:|
| üéÆ C2 Server | 1 | Sends attack commands to zombie machines |
| üîÑ Reflection Amplification Servers | 5 | Used for Layer 4 DDoS reflection amplification attacks |
| ü§ñ Zombie Machines | 2 | Execute various attacks |
| üîç Unbound DNS Resolver | 1 | Configured for pulse attacks |
| üåê DNS Authoritative Server | 1 | Accumulates and amplifies pulse attack requests |
| üß† DeepSeek 1.5B Server | 1 | Simulates HTTP attacks targeting AI services |

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Note**: This simulation environment focuses on DDoS simulation and does not simulate botnet propagation or communication mechanisms (e.g., brute-forcing weak passwords, DGA searching for C2, etc.). These features may be added in future versions.

Other nodes are automatically generated by SeedEmu. For more details, refer to the [SeedEmu official documentation](https://github.com/seed-labs/seed-emulator).

## üí• Attack Types

DDoSKING covers various types of DDoS attacks, primarily categorized as follows:

### 1. üåä Link Flooding Attacks (Layer 4)

Attacks that saturate network bandwidth with high traffic, including:

- **Direct Attacks**: UDP Flood
- **Reflection Amplification Attacks**: DNS, NTP, CLDAP, SSDP, etc.

### 2. üîã Resource Exhaustion Attacks (Layer 7)

Attacks that deplete server computational resources, including:

- **HTTP Flood**: Lightweight web service with a single page
- **Complex Prompts for DeepSeek**: Consumes AI service resources
- **SYN Flood**: Exhausts the target's half-open connection queue

### 3. ‚ö° Pulse Attacks

Pulse attacks send high-bandwidth packets in short bursts, filling target queues, causing timeouts, and triggering TCP congestion control, degrading the target's TCP services.

- **DNSBomb**: A practical and powerful pulsing DoS attack exploiting DNS queries and responses. Reference: [DNSBomb: A New Practical-and-Powerful Pulsing DoS Attack Exploiting DNS Queries-and-Responses | IEEE Conference Publication | IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10646654)

- **DNSBoomerang**: An enhancement of DNSBomb that significantly increases cumulative data (the number of cumulative packets grows with the number of DNS reflectors). In public experiments, attackers accumulated requests at 530kbps from 500 different reflectors. After 17 seconds (13,700 requests), the reflected bandwidth reached 108Mbps for about 1 second, achieving a 204x amplification.

## üöÄ Environment Setup

It is recommended to set up the environment on Linux. Windows users can use WSL.

### üì¶ Installation Steps

#### 1. Install and Configure Docker

- Install Docker: [Refer to the official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- **Note**: Users in mainland China may need to configure Docker mirror sources due to potential access issues with DockerHub.

#### 2. Install Project Dependencies

```bash
# Run in the project root directory
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Set Python environment variables
source development.dev
```

### üèÉ Start the Simulation Environment

```bash
# Run in the root directory
python3 ddosking.py

# Build and start Docker containers
cd output
docker-compose build  # Initial build may take about 30 minutes
docker-compose up

# Shut down the simulation environment
docker-compose down
```

To ensure proper operation of spoofed packet sending, you need to clear the NAT rules built by Docker:

```bash
iptables -t nat -F
```

> **üí° Tip**: It is recommended to save the NAT rules before clearing them so they can be restored during debugging.

```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Attack Configuration

Zombie machines in the botnet need to be configured with the IP addresses of the C2 server, reflectors, and Unbound DNS resolver.

### C2 Server Setup

```bash
cd /root/c2
go run .  # Start the C2 server to begin listening
```

### Zombie Node Setup

```bash
# Automatically configured, no manual operation required
cd /root/bot
go run .  # Start the service and connect to the C2 server
```

### Reflector Node Setup

```bash
cd /root/reflector
go run .  # Start the service
# Enter 1 to begin listening
```

### Unbound Server Setup

```bash
# Used for pulse attacks
service unbound start  # Start the service
```

### DeepSeek Node Setup

```bash
# Pre-install tmux, then enter tmux and run the command to start
tmux
OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0 ollama serve

# After starting, press ctrl b+d to exit, then start the terminal session in another terminal
ollama run deepseek-r1:1.5b
```

### Attack Parameter Adjustment

You can modify the packet sending rate and other attack parameters in `bot/attacker/attack/config.go`.

## üìù Notes

1. **Reflection Amplification Attack Traffic Limitation**: After receiving packets, reflectors construct and forward packets. Due to CPU performance limitations, reflection amplification attack traffic is much smaller than direct UDP attacks (after the attack stops, reflectors continue processing unhandled packets, extending the attack duration). Adjust the attack rate accordingly.
2. **Network Issues**: If network issues occur during use, try clearing the iptables rules.
3. **Safe Usage**: Use this tool in a secure environment for learning and research purposes only.
